IDEA: 

1.) Software Deveolpment Projectl JOB POSTING Website  
2.) Helpful YT series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqhxxeeTbu0&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-n4vJJybUVV3Un_NFS5EOgX&ab_channel=TechWithTim

3.) 

Job Posting Website Ideas: n/a

4.) Basic Layout of website:

- Simple job posting and search system. (Basic) 

Unique features (we can choose): 

- Basic student profile creation.
- Job alerts based on student preferences.
  . For every job there would be a set of skills and that we’d provide sources that are credible and reviewed by us for all of the skills.
- A basic resume builder.
- Categorized job listings for internships and part-time work. 
  . For every company we’d hire people who’ve worked at that company who would offer training to anyone who wants to apply for the company.

    . Database: >> |Tool: MySql or PostgreSQL| <> |PL: SQL|
    . Connection 1: (Database-Backend):  >> |FrameWork: SQLAlchemy| <> |PL: Python|
    . Back-end (Server-side): >> |FrameWork: Flask| <> |PL: Python|
    . Connection 2 (Backend-Frontend): >> |Framework: AJAX or Fetch API| <> |PL: JavaScript|
    . Front-end (Client-Side): >> |Framework: Jinja2 or Bootstrap| <> |PL: HTML or CSS or JS|
