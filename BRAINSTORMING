IDEA:

2.) Helpful YT series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqhxxeeTbu0&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-n4vJJybUVV3Un_NFS5EOgX&ab_channel=TechWithTim

3.) 

Job Posting Website Ideas: 

-For every job there would be a set of skills and that we’d provide sources that are credible and reviewed by us for all of the skills.
-For every company we’d hire people who’ve worked at that company who would offer training to anyone who wants to apply for the company.

4.) Basic Layout of website:

-Simple job posting and search system. (Basic) 

Unique features (we can choose): 

-Basic student profile creation.
-Job alerts based on student preferences.
-A basic resume builder.
-Categorized job listings for internships and part-time work.
