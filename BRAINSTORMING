Job Posting Website Ideas: n/a

4.) Basic Layout of website:

- Simple job posting and search system. (Basic) 

Unique features (we can choose): 

- Basic student profile creation.
- Job alerts based on student preferences.
  . For every job there would be a set of skills and that we’d provide sources that are credible and reviewed by us for all of the skills.
- A basic resume builder.
- Categorized job listings for internships and part-time work. 
  . For every company we’d hire people who’ve worked at that company who would offer training to anyone who wants to apply for the company.

5.) Poteintal PL for creation: 

- Website
    . MySql/PostgreSQL  = database 
    . Database-Backend Connection:  ORM - Object-Relational Mapping via SQLAlchemy using Flask
    . Flask = Backend (Server-Side).
    . Backend-Frontend Connection: AJAX or Fetch API
    . HTML/CSS/JS = Frontend (Client-Side).
