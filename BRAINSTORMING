Brainstorming v1

IDEA: 

1.) Software Deveolpment Projectl JOB POSTING Website  
2.) Helpful YT series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqhxxeeTbu0&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-n4vJJybUVV3Un_NFS5EOgX&ab_channel=TechWithTim

3.) 

Job Posting Website Ideas: (Some starter features)
- Effective Connection with Mentors
- Filter job application
- Available to keep track of job application
- Give suggestions on resume and cover letter creation
- Get access to internships and entry-level jobs
- Company rankings for verified incorporations

4.) Basic Layout of website:

- Simple job posting and search system -> Focused on new-grads and students trying to launch their careers. Efficient filtering for different
  job types

Unique features (we can choose): 

- Basic student profile creation. -> Allow in attaching files, connecting with others and getting job recommendations 
- Job alerts based on student preferences.
  . For every job there would be a set of skills and that we’d provide sources that are credible and reviewed by us for all of the skills.
- A basic resume builder.
- Categorized job listings for internships and part-time work. 
  . For every company we’d hire people who’ve worked at that company who would offer training to anyone who wants to apply for the company.
  . These mentors will help develop the needed skills, allow in effective connections and launch their careers in the industry 

5.) FrameWorks and Programming Languages (PL)

Database <------------> Back-end  <------------> Front-end
 (1)                      (2)                      (3) 

- Website
    . Database: >> |Tool: MySql or PostgreSQL| <> |PL: SQL|
    . Connection 1: (Database-Backend):  >> |FrameWork: SQLAlchemy| <> |PL: Python|
    . Back-end (Server-side): >> |FrameWork: Flask| <> |PL: Python|
    . Connection 2 (Backend-Frontend): >> |Framework: AJAX or Fetch API| <> |PL: JavaScript|
    . Front-end (Client-Side): >> |Framework: Jinja2 or Bootstrap| <> |PL: HTML or CSS or JS| 

- Side notes Connection 1 uses ORM - Object-Relational Mapping to make it easier to connect Database
